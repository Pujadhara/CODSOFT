CodSoft Java Development Internship -
Welcome to the CodSoft Java Development Internship repository! This documents shows my progress and assignments during my internship journey . Here I will be working on the set of tasks given by the CodSoft which will enhance my skills and knowledge in Java Development.

## TASK-1 (NUMBER GAME)
1. Generate a random number within a specified range, such as 1 to 100.
2. Prompt the user to enter their guess for the generated number.
3. Compare the user's guess with the generated number and provide feedback on whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the user guesses the correct number.
5. Limit the number of attempts the user has to guess the number.
6. Add the option for multiple rounds, allowing the user to play again.
7. Display the user's score, which can be based on the number of attempts taken or rounds won.

5. Connect the ATM class with the user's bank account class to access and modify the account balance.
6. Validate user input to ensure it is within acceptable limits (e.g., sufficient balance for withdrawals).
